  1. Alfresco supports all the three publishing options that Quickr provides:
    * _Replace with a Link_: the document is removed from Quickr library and added to Alfresco. A link pointing to the document in Alfresco is added to the Quickr Library. Click the link in Quickr to open the document in Alfresco.
    * _Create a Copy_: the document remains in Quickr library, and a copy is added to Alfresco.
    * _Move the Document_: the document is deleted from the Quickr library and is added to Alfresco.
