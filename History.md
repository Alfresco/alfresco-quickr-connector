The Alfresco Quickr integration was introduced in Alfresco 3.3 as our first integration largely based off of the CMIS protocol. It was officially maintained and supported by Alfresco as an Enterprise-only integration.

With the release of Alfresco 4.0, Alfresco stopped officially supporting this plugin, and donated the code to this community project.
