Immediate Tasks:
* If you edit a file that still has [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FILE CONTENTS] in the
  header notice, please update it with a good description.
* If you edit a file that does not have a copyright notice, please add it.
* Stop it from pointing at an exploded war file for build and point it at the SDK.
* Check that it builds.
* Add compatibility for Alfresco 4.
